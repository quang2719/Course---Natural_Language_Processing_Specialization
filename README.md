## üìö Course Overview

This specialization delves into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), equipping learners with the skills to build cutting-edge NLP systems. The course covers a wide range of topics, from traditional techniques like classification and probabilistic models to the latest advancements in sequence models and attention mechanisms.

## üîç Specialization Structure

The specialization is divided into four distinct courses:

1.  **Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces:** This course introduces the fundamental concepts of NLP, including text classification, vector space models, and word embeddings.

2.  **Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models:**  This course explores probabilistic models for NLP, such as Naive Bayes, hidden Markov models, and word2vec.

3.  **Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models:** This course covers sequence models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are essential for tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis.

4.  **Natural Language Processing with Attention Models:** This course introduces attention mechanisms, a key innovation in NLP that has led to breakthroughs in machine translation, text summarization, and question-answering systems.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

*   **Course Notes:** Summaries of key concepts and takeaways from each module.
*   **Code Examples:** Python code implementations of NLP techniques and algorithms.
*   **Assignments (Optional):** Solutions to course assignments (if included).
